# Database

## Relational Database

1. What's the output?

```sql
create table Person(fname varchar(20), id integer);

insert into Person values('Tom', 1);
insert into Person values('Sam', 2);
insert into Person values('Tom', 3);

select fname
from Person
where count(*) <> 1
```

```bash
The query is wrong. Can't use aggregate function with where clause
```

2. What's the difference between self join & cross join?

3. What's an index? How's it different than a view? Which is faster? Can we save a view into database?

```bash
Index are data structure that provides quick lookup of data in a column or columns of a table.

CREATE INDEX  INDEX_NAME
ON table_name(column1, column2);

```

View is simply a select query that is saved in database.

```bash
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW <view_name> as
SELECT ...

```

View query is saved in database but is not run until called. Hence it does not take any space in database. It's also used for restricting access.

Yes, it's called a materialized view which is created & stored in disk. It has to be re-run when data changes in the table.

4. What's the difference between clusterd and non-clustered index? Which one is faster?

Clustered index are indexes whose order of rows in database correspond to the order of rows in index. It modifies the way records are stored in the database.

Non-clustered index creates a separate entity witin table which references original table.

5. Can more than one clustered index exist on a given table?

No
